My favourite type of music is Hip hop music, also called hip-hop or rap music. It is a genre of popular music developed in the United States by inner-city African Americans and Latino Americans in the Bronx borough of New York City in the 1970s.

The reason why I like Hip Hop hop music is that it gives a great energy every time I listen to it. I started listening to hip hop music in high school. Ever since then, hip hop is always my go-to music when I workout at the gym, play sports, or just in a car ride. 

I enjoy all kinds of music, but hip hop/ rap music will always be my No. 1 choice.
