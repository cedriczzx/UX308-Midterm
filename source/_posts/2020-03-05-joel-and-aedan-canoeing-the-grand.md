My favourite street art artist is Brian Donnelly, known professionally as Kaws, is an American artist and designer. 

KAWS is a multi-faceted artist straddling the worlds of art and design in his prolific body of work that ranges from paintings, murals, and large-scale sculptures to product design and toy-making. His iconic “XX” signature has its roots in the beginning of his career as a street artist in the 1990s, when he began altering found advertisements by incorporating his own masterful paintings.

Today, KAWS is a famous artist worldwide. He has his art shows in lots of different countries including Japan, China, the U.S., Canada, Australia, etc. He also collabrated with lots of famous brands including Nike, Uniqlo, Hennessy, Dior, etc. 

I went to his art show few years ago when I visited China, and I had a very fun time experincing his contemporary art. It was mordern and fun which is different than the arts we would see at our local art galleries.
