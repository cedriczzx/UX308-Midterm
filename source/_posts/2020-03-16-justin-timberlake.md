My favourite music artist is Justin Timberlake, also known by his initials "JT".

I started listening to his music when I was in elementary school. And now every time I listen to his music, it always bring me back to those good old memories.

My favourite songs by Justin Timberlake are: "Can't stop the feeling", "True colors", "Cry me a river", "Suit & Tie", etc.

I hope one day I will have the opportunity to go to his concert, that would make my dream come true!
