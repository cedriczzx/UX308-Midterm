When it comes to paintings, one of my favourit artist is Vincent Van Gogh.

Two years ago, I visited the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam where I learned a lot about Vincent Van Gogh's personal stories and arts. The Van Gogh museum was founded in 1973 where most of Van Gogh's art work is still remain until today. Some of his most famous paintings include "The Starry Night", "Van Gogh self-portrait", "Sunflowers", "Almond Blossoms", "Cafe Terrace at Night", etc.

I gathered 10 facts that I learned about Vincent van Gogh: 

1. He likely suffered from multiple mental illnesses. 

2. He didn't start painting until he was 27. 

3. He was a prolific artist. His sunflowers painting was sold for $62 million dollars in 1987 which made art history.

4. 4 of the top 30 most expensive paintings in history are by Van Gogh.

5. He only sold one painting during his lifetime.

6. His time in Paris turned him into a master.

7. He was made famous by his sister-in-law after his death.

8. He painted some of his iconic art works while in an asylum.

9. There is a theory that Van Gogh was murdered.

10. His self-portrait work made him the first selfie king.

I hope you learned something new about my favourite artist Vincent Van Gogh after reading this post. :)
